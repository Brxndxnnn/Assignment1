Feature Created: Map and Events

**Map** - Created a new map feature due to most people are not aware where these bins are located to recycle in the event that their items are not able to be upcycled
          so i created the map feature for user to be able to locate where are the e-waste bin or recycling bin located at as. 
          Firebase Firestore is used to store the location and description of the ewaste bin/recycling bin (image, url, details, title, address, longitude and latitude).

Feature involves:

1. Allow users to locate e-waste / recycling bin through pop up markers shown based on their current location.
2. Allow user select on the e-waste / recycling bin pop up markers shown
3. Allow user to tap onto the pop up maker to get more information
4. To protect user privacy,the app will prompt a request location permissions - (deny, only this time and while using the app)

User is able to use the map feature to see where are the e-waste/ recycling bin are located at.
1. User will need to choose the permission requested by the app once acessing the map feature. location permissions - (deny, only this time and while using the app)
2. User will then be able to zoom into the map
3. User can tap onto the e-waste/recycling bin markers that is on the map based on their location, once user tap onto the chosen markers user will be able to see more    information




**Events** - Created a new feature where can see what event are happening on the date through the calender.

Feature involves:

1. Allow user to see the types of event happening based on the date that can seen on the calender
2. User can tap onto the events to see more details about it

How to use Event feature

User can tap on the date and the different events will pop up. user can then select the event that looks intersting to them and it will bring them to more details on the event. 

Improvements I made to Application since Assignment 1:

1. Added a new map feature for user to see where are the e-waste bin located based on their current location
2. Add a new event features (used CalenderView, RecyclerView)
3. New Child added to the Realtime Firebase (Location) to store the e-waste location so user can see based on their location
