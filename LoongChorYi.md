Loong Chor Yi's Contribution for Assignment 2

Feature Created: Likes Page to store listings/tutorials users are interested in

Users are able to save the listings/tutorials they like, making it easier for them to reference to it when they want/need to.

Feature involves:

1. Favourite/unfavourite button to enable users to indicate their preferences (i.e. whether to store it to/remove from the liked page)
2. Users able to toggle between liked listings and liked tutorials page
3. Users able to choose to view all listings or particular listings in its own category
4. Users able to create categories to store their listings
5. Realtime Firebase to store liked listings, tutorials and created categories

Improvements I made to the Application since Assignment 1:

1. Added Likes page for users to view their liked listings and tutorials
2. Included elements of personalization (e.g. able to create category to store listings) through the implemented feature (Likes Page)
