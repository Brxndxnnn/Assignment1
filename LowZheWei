Zhe Wei's Contribution for Assignment 2

Feature Created: Basic search feature for the listing items, as well as the search history feature to allow users to view their recent searches. 
Created to complement the existing Listing Feature to allow user to search for their desired listing items. 
Realtime Firebase was used to store the Search History of each user.

Feature involves:

1. A new user interface for the users to search for listing items.
2. Allow users to view details of the listing item that the user search for. 
3. Open the SearchView wiget immediately when the user wants to search for a listing item.
4. Allow users to view their search history. 
5. Allow users to delete their search history records.
6. Allow users to clear their search history.

Improvements I made to Application since Assignment 1:

1. Added basic search feature for the user 
2. Added search history feature for the users to view the listing items that they searched previously. 
3. New Child added to the Realtime Firebase (SearchHistory) to store what items each user search
4. Created new user interface for the users to search for listing items (Added SearchView widget, RecyclerView)
