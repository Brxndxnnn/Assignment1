Tay Xin Ying's Contribution for Assignment 2

Feature Created:

A basic rewards feature was implemented to increase user retention and boost user engagement. Users may gain points by completing daily activities like checking in and spinning the wheel. They can get the voucher they desire by using the points they have accumulated.

Feature involves:

1. A new user interface for the reward system, with the access to “Check-In”, “Spin the Wheel” and “Redeem”.
2. Realtime Firebase to store rewards and user points. (Rewards, User)
3. Getting current date to allow user to claim their daily check in.
4. Using Rotate Animation to allow user to spin for daily rewards.
5. Redemption of vouchers (Recycler View, Card View)
6. Glide Library to load the logo of the vouchers.

Improvements I made to Application since Assignment 1:

1. Added rewards feature for the user. 
2. New Child added to the Realtime Firebase (Rewards) to store the available vouchers.
3. Using CardView for the voucher details display in RecyclerView.
4. Utilizing RotateAnimation to allow the spinning of the wheel to occur.
