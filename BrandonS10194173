Brandon's Contribution for Assignment 2

Feature Created: Realtime Chat Feature that allows Users of application to Message one another. 
Created to complement the existing Listing Feature to allow User to chat with the person who posted the Listings. 
Firebase Firestore is used to store the Messages and Conversations.

Feature involves:

1. Realtime Chat between 2 Users.
2. List of past/current conversations with Users (Chat History)
3. Shows User profile picture.
4. Able to chat with multiple users at once.
5. Able to check whether User you're chatting with is online.
6. Glide Library to load the user images in the chat.

Improvements I made to Application since Assignment 1:

1. Made Listings page consistent (all listings the same size, no different sizes listings which causes inconsistencies in Recyclerview)
2. Improve UI/UX of the User Profile page. Made everything much neater including changing the arrangements of the Textview and Buttons.
3. Now allow User to upload a Profile Pic of themselves, which is stored in Realtime Database and Storage.
4. Updated UI/UX of Listings Details page. Now allow User to Chat with the person who posted the Listings through the page immediately.
5. Remove deprecated methods in the project and replace it with non-deprecated methods instead.
6. Reformat the Buttons in the Homepage, making each Button unique and does not load to a Activity that is already in the Navigation Bar. 
7. Overall improvements made to the UI/UX of the Application.
8. Overall Bug fixes.
