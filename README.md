### App Description:
```
Our group's goal is to upcycle and re-use old products in order to create a more sustainable world.

The purpose of our mobile application is to teach people of all ages how to safeguard the environment by upcycling everything around them and the importance of natural resource conservation.

Recyclops is a platform that allows users to list secondhand items and learn upcycling. Unlike Carousell, which allows people to sell new or old items for cash, 
our project only allows users to list secondhand items for free and can raise awareness to users about the importance of buying second hand and upcycling. 
They can utilize this platform to post their unused or unwanted items that are still in good working condition and see who needs that item, instead of just throwing it away. Likewise, people can also use this platform to source for items that people are giving away. 
Users can also contribute by posting various videos on ways on how we can upcycle and make use of the unused items around us.

When the user is navigated to this page, the SearchView widget will open automatically. In the widget, the user can search for any listing items that they want. 
Once the user submits their search query, he will be navigated to the listing details page (Next Image) of the item that he has searched for. 

The search query that the user search for will be recorded as a search history record. When the user navigates back to the list search page, he will be able to see the item that he has just searched. 

The remove icon (in red) is for the user to delete a particular search history record. When the user clicks on the remove icon, a toast message will pop up to indicate that the "Search History Record" has been successfully deleted. The record will disappear from the list search page. 

The "Clear All" text is for the user to clear his search history. When the user clicks on the "Clear All" text, a toast message will pop up to indicate that the user's search history has been successfully cleared. The list items that the user has searched for preiusly would be cleared. 

When the user clicks on "Cancel", the user will be navigated back to the listings page.
