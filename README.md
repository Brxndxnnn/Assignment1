### App Description:
```
Our group's goal is to upcycle and buy old products in order to create a more sustainable world.

The purpose of our mobile application is to teach people of all ages how to safeguard the environment by upcycling everything around them and the importance of natural resource conservation.

Recyclops is a platform that allows users to list secondhand items and learn upcycling. Unlike Carousell, which allows people to sell new or old items for cash, 
our project only allows users to list secondhand items for free and can raise awareness to users about the importance of buying second hand and upcycling. 
They can utilize this platform to buy supplies for their own projects. Users can also contribute their upcycling suggestions. 
Finally, through tutorials, our product will show consumers how to upcycle in unique ways.
