### App Description:
```
Our group's goal is to upcycle and re-use old products in order to create a more sustainable world.

The purpose of our mobile application is to teach people of all ages how to safeguard the environment by upcycling everything around them and the importance of natural resource conservation.

Recyclops is a platform that allows users to list secondhand items and learn upcycling. Unlike Carousell, which allows people to sell new or old items for cash, 
our project only allows users to list secondhand items for free and can raise awareness to users about the importance of buying second hand and upcycling. 
They can utilize this platform to post their unused or unwanted items that are still in good working condition and see who needs that item, instead of just throwing it away. Likewise, people can also use this platform to source for items that people are giving away. 
Users can also contribute by posting various videos on ways on how we can upcycle and make use of the unused items around us. 

```
